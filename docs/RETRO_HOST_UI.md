# The emulator host in the launcher's UI

[The emulator host client](RETRO_HOST_CLIENT.md) talks to the emulator host
(the separate program that runs PS1 games). This page covers the UI built on
it: a game's picture in the launcher, the object that runs one game in one
host, the controllers that play it, the model of its in-game menu, and how
the launcher plays a PS1 disc from its emulator library through all of them
(behind a setting that is off by default, see "In the launcher").

Each piece does one job and can be used alone. A settings preview can use
`RetroFrameView` with any picture, and a menu can follow `RetroHostGame` without
showing the picture.

## From frame to picture

The host writes each frame into shared memory and sends `frame`. The client
pins the newest frame and adds an event to `frames`
(`RetroHostClient.frames`). `RetroFrameImage` listens to that stream:

1. **It copies the frame right away.** On each event marked `drawn`, it copies
   the frame's `height` rows of `width` × 4 bytes into a Dart list. The
   client's documentation says why it cannot wait: a frame "stays readable until
   another frame replaces it", and a frame that was not drawn "can be read only
   until the next message". So the copy is made while the event is handled,
   before any other message can arrive. After that, nothing the host writes can
   change the picture.
2. **It makes an image from the copy.** `decodeImageFromPixels` uploads it,
   with `PixelFormat.rgba8888` or `PixelFormat.bgra8888` to match the frame's
   format. Both formats come out as the same colours.
3. **It keeps up by skipping.** Uploading takes time. Frames that arrive during
   an upload are not queued: only the newest one is kept, and it is uploaded
   next. The protocol's `frame` section says this is correct: "Frames can be
   skipped; only the newest frame matters."
4. **It owns the image.** When a new image is ready, the old one is disposed
   and listeners are told. `RawImage` keeps its own clone, so a picture being
   painted is never disposed under it.

Only events marked `drawn` are shown. The client marks a frame drawn only when
its `epoch` belongs to the current game, so a frame left over from a game that
was stopped is never shown. When a game starts or ends, `clear()` removes the
picture and drops any upload still running. `RetroHostGame` also sets
`accepting` to false from the moment its game ends, is stopped or the host is
being shut down, until the next game is accepted. A frame that still arrives in
that time (the client keeps marking frames drawn until `release`) is ignored,
so the old game's last picture never comes back.

When the ring has no frame, the client adds an event with no frame. The picture
then stays as it is, which is what the protocol asks: "the launcher keeps
showing what it showed before".

## The picture on screen

`RetroFrameView` draws a black box. Inside it, centred, is an `AspectRatio`
with the core's display aspect ratio, which holds a `RawImage` stretched to
fill it. So the PS1's non-square pixels look right, and any spare space is
black bars. Pixels are not smoothed by default (`FilterQuality.none`). Before
the first frame only the black box is drawn.

`RetroHostGameView` takes the aspect ratio from `RetroHostGame.aspect`, which
comes from the game's last `status` ("aspect": "The display aspect ratio the
core reports; 1.3333333333333333 until it reports one").

## One game in one host: `RetroHostGame`

`RetroHostGame` runs one game on one `RetroHostSession` and owns the
`RetroFrameImage` of its frames. The session is its own until it is shut down
or detached (below), so the next game can start on the same host.
`RetroHostGame.launch(command: …)` starts a real host;
`RetroHostGame(session)` takes any session: one the launcher just started,
one kept from the last game, or a fake in the tests.

| Phase | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `idle` | No game started yet. |
| `starting` | Waiting for the host's `welcome` and the reply to `start`. |
| `loading` | `start` was accepted; `status.ready` is still false. |
| `playing` | `status.ready` is true. |
| `ended` | The game ended. `endStatus` holds the status it ended with (`errorCode` says why), and `failure` holds the reason when `start` was refused or no status came. |
| `closed` | The host was shut down. |

- **Start.** `start(RetroHostStartRequest)` waits for `ready`, sends `start`
  with the protocol's fields (`core`, `disc`, `system`, `saves`, and `options`
  and `initialDisc` only when given), clears the picture, and then asks
  `status` every 500 ms while a game is loaded. Only one game is started per
  `RetroHostGame`.
- **Status.** Each `status` updates the aspect ratio. A ready status moves the
  game from `loading` to `playing`. An ended status ends it. After a host
  failure, the client's own short failure report (`errorCode` `hostExited` or
  `hostHung`) ends it the same way. When the host's connection ends, the game
  asks `status` at once instead of waiting for the next poll.
- **Input.** `input(port, buttons, …)` forwards a controller state to the host,
  but only while a game is loaded and the window has input focus
  (`acceptsInput`). The client zeroes both ports when focus is lost, so
  dropping input while the window has no focus keeps them at zero.
- **Game calls.** `connectedPorts`, `changeDisc` and `setOption` send the
  protocol's methods of the same names, and only while a game is loaded. Each
  gives the host's `true` or `false`. It gives `false` when the call fails,
  and a host failure is then seen by the next status. After a disc change or
  an option the host took, `status` is asked at once, so the menu shows it.
- **Volume.** `setVolume` sends `volume` once the host has greeted the
  launcher, with or without a game. `volume` and `muted` keep what the player
  chose. `RetroHostGame.launch` starts the host with them, and the client
  sends them after `welcome`, as the protocol asks.
- **Pausing.** The game is paused while the player paused it or while the
  window has no focus, and these two are tracked apart. Losing focus pauses
  the game (`pause` with `true`). Getting focus back resumes it, unless the
  player had paused it. A game started while the window has no focus is
  paused as soon as `start` is accepted. `pause` is sent only when the
  combined state changes.
- **Focus.** `setFocused` also sets `RetroHostClient.inputFocus`, which zeroes
  the controllers and their motors, as the protocol's `input` and `rumble`
  sections require. `RetroHostFocus` takes focus from the app's lifecycle:
  the window has focus while it is `resumed`, and loses it when it is
  inactive, hidden or paused. After its first frame, and whenever it is given
  another game, it also passes on the state the app is already in. So a view
  opened while the window has no focus still pauses its game.
  Once the host has ended or been shut down, focus is still recorded but no
  longer passed to the client, whose streams are closed by then.
- **How the host ended.** `hostEnd` is the connection's end once it has one.
  `RetroHostEnd.unsupported` means the host speaks no protocol version this
  launcher offered, which the launcher shows as an emulator that needs
  updating (protocol.md "Host failure").
- **Stop.** `stop()` calls `stopGame()` (which enforces the 10-second stop
  limit), then `release`, and returns the status the game ended with. Stopping
  a game that is still `starting` cancels it. If `start` was not sent yet, it
  never is. If it was sent, the game is stopped and released as soon as the
  host's reply comes, and `stop()` waits for that.
- **Shut down.** `shutdown()` sends `shutdown`, waits for the connection to
  end (the client kills a host that has not exited within 15 seconds), then
  calls `close()`. `dispose()` shuts down too. Calling `shutdown()` again
  returns the same shutdown.
- **Detach.** `detach()` lets go of the host without shutting it down, so the
  next game can start on it. protocol.md "Processes" says "One host runs games
  one after another until the launcher exits or the host fails." It stops the
  game if it still runs, then calls `release` even for a game that ended on
  its own, since `start` is `busy` "if a game is loaded, running or ended",
  and asks `status`. It gives true only when the host still runs and `status`
  is `null`, that is, no game is loaded. Otherwise it shuts the host down and
  gives false. That covers a host that crashed, one still holding a game, a
  failed call, and the host protocol.md "release" describes, which "sends the
  reply to `release` and exits" after a game stuck in its core: it answers
  no `status` after that reply, so the call fails. A detached game's phase is
  `closed`, it sends nothing more, and `dispose()` leaves the host running.
  The window's focus is given back to the host (`inputFocus` true), as a new
  host starts with it, since the next game tells it its own.

Nothing here waits on the host on the UI thread. Every wait is a `Future`,
and the client's time limits make sure each one ends.

## Controllers: `RetroHostControls`

`RetroHostControls` turns the launcher's controllers into the protocol's
`input` messages for one `RetroHostGame`. It reads them through a
`RetroPadReader`: the ids of the controllers connected now, in the launcher's
order with Player 1 first, and each one's `PadState`.
`RetroPadReader.inventory` reads a reader's `PadInventory` (SDL, or XInput
and winmm, or evdev).

**Buttons and sticks.** `RetroPadInput.fromPad` follows the bit table of the
protocol's `input` section: Cross 0, Square 1, Select 2, Start 3, D-pad up,
down, left and right 4 to 7, Circle 8, Triangle 9, L1 10, R1 11, L2 12, R2
13, L3 14, R3 15. Buttons go by their place on the pad, as the launcher's
readers name them (`south` is Cross, `east` Circle, `west` Square, `north`
Triangle), so an Xbox pad's A is Cross. PS/Guide, the touchpad and the extra
button send nothing: PS stays the launcher's (home, close the game). A trigger
counts as L2 or R2 from the point where the SDL reader counts it pressed
(0.35). The protocol says "-32768 is fully left or fully up". The launcher's
sticks go from -1 to 1 with down positive, so -1 becomes -32768 and 1
becomes 32767. Settings › Controllers › Stick Dead Zone (`deadzonePercent`)
applies to each stick. The older readers (XInput and winmm, evdev) give no
right stick or analogue triggers, so with them the right stick stays centred.

**Ports.** `RetroSeats` gives each controller a port and keeps it there while
the controller stays connected, so a press on another pad never swaps the
players. When the game starts, Player 1 (the controller used last) is at port
1 and the next controller at port 2. A controller that leaves frees its port.
The other player stays where they are, and the next controller to connect
takes the free port. Port 2 counts as connected while a controller sits
there. The protocol's `connectedPorts` section says "A game starts with 1",
so `connectedPorts` with `2` is sent when the game loads with two
controllers or a second one sits down, and `1` when it leaves. Port 1 always
has a controller in the host. Controls made for a game that is already loaded
do not know what the host has, so they send the count on their first read.

**Sending.** The controllers are read every 16 ms, as the SDL reader polls
them. A port's state is sent when it changes. The protocol says the launcher
sends it "when the state changes, and once with all zeros when a game starts
or input focus is lost", and the client sends those zeros itself. So whenever
the game stops taking input (not loaded, or no focus), the controls forget
what they sent, and send both ports again in full once it takes input again.
They follow the game's changes as they happen, not only at each read, so
focus lost and back within 16 ms is not missed. A controller held through a
focus change therefore reaches the game again when focus comes back. A port
whose controller left is sent as idle. While `suspended` is true (the in-game
menu is open), both ports are sent as idle. When it becomes false, the
controllers are seated again first, and the buttons held at that moment stay
out of the game until they are let go, as
the launcher's own `PadGate` does when the launcher comes back in front. The
sticks come back at once.

**Vibration.** The protocol's `rumble` section says the launcher "forwards
them to the controller seated at that port, if it can vibrate". So each
`RetroHostGame.rumble` event goes to the controller at that port when the
reader's `PadRumble.canRumble` says it can, as `strong / 65535` and
`weak / 65535`. The controllers are seated again before a `rumble` is routed,
so one that just took a free port gets it. A `rumble` holds until the next one, but the SDL and evdev
readers stop the motors after the length they are given. So a level that is
not zero is given for `rumbleHold` (2 s) and given again every second. The
client already gives zeros for both ports when the game starts, pauses, ends
or loses focus, and gives nothing while paused or without focus. The controls
add the protocol's last case, "when a controller leaves its port": its motors
stop. They also stop every motor once no game is loaded, because a host that
is shut down sends no `rumble` and the client gives no zeros for a clean end.
From then on they ignore any `rumble` that still comes. Setting `vibration`
to false stops the motors and keeps later rumble away. `dispose` stops any
motor the game left running. It also sends idle for a port whose controller
held something, so a game that goes on is not left with a held button.

## The in-game menu: `RetroGameMenu`

`RetroGameMenu` is the menu's model. It shows no widget: a menu view lists
`rows` and calls the actions. The rows come from the game's last `status`:

- **Discs.** For a game with more than one disc, one `RetroDiscRow` per entry
  of `status.discs.labels`, with the inserted disc marked. A row can be
  chosen when it is not the inserted disc and no change is in progress
  (`discs.busy`). `chooseDisc` sends `changeDisc` with the row's index, which
  the protocol defines as "the index into `discs.labels`". `discChangeFailed`
  is `discs.failed`.
- **Core options.** One `RetroOptionRow` per entry of `status.options` that
  is shown (below), in the host's order. `title` is SwanStation's title
  without its own " (Restart)", since the menu says that under every option
  whose `restart` is true. `section` is where the row goes, and
  `optionsIn(section)` gives the rows of one section. `choice` is the label of
  `selected`. `pending` is true while the chosen value is not yet the
  `activeValue`, and `restartNeeded` is the option's `restart`.
  `stepOption(key, steps)` moves through `values` and stops at the first and
  last. It sends `option` with `key` and `value`.
- **Volume.** A `RetroVolumeRow` with the game's `volume` and `muted`.
  `stepVolume` moves it by tenths from 0 to 1, and turning it up unmutes.
  `toggleMute` switches `muted`.

**Sections.** The host lists every option SwanStation lets the player change
now: fifty for a PS1 game with the host and SwanStation recorded in
[`test/fixtures/retro-host-swanstation-status.json`](../test/fixtures/retro-host-swanstation-status.json).
`retroOptionSection(key)` sorts them by SwanStation's key,
`swanstation_<Group>_<Name>`, so an option a later SwanStation adds still
finds its place:

| Section | SwanStation options |
| --- | --- |
| Graphics (the game's Graphics page, not the menu) | `GPU_*` and `Display_*` |
| Audio | `Audio_*` and Mute CD Audio (`CDROM_MuteCDAudio`) |
| Controller | `Controller*` (`Controller_`, `Controller1_`, `Controller2_`, `ControllerPorts_`) |
| Console | `Console_*`, `BIOS_*`, CD-ROM Region Check, Read Speedup and Seek Speedup, CPU Overclocking |
| Advanced | everything else: the CPU's execution mode, how the disc is read, compatibility settings, run-ahead, hacks, and any group not named here |

Ten options are not shown, since players have no use for them in the
launcher: the on-screen messages (the host draws none), the four display
offsets (sixty-one steps of SwanStation's own calibration each), texture
replacements (the host gives SwanStation no texture folder), the development
console's 8 MB of RAM (no game sold uses it), the CPU recompiler's three
debugging switches, and the light gun crosshair (the host plugs in only
DualShocks). A value kept for one of them from before is not sent in `start`,
so nobody is left with a setting they can no longer change.

`open()` pauses the game (`pause` with `true`, the same as the player's own
pause) and sets the controls' `suspended`, so presses in the menu never reach
the game. `close()` gives the controllers back at once, so a button still
held from the menu reaches the game only once it is pressed again, then
resumes the game. Neither does anything after waiting for the host, so
opening the menu again while a close still waits for its reply keeps the
controllers out. A menu disposed while open closes the same way. A game that
is not loaded has no menu to open.

## The Graphics page: `RetroGraphics`

`RetroGraphics` is the Graphics page of one game. Like `RetroGameMenu` it
shows no widget. It follows the game's `status`, sends `option` through
`RetroHostGame.setOption`, and keeps what the host took in a
`RetroGraphicsProfile`, calling `save` after each change.

**The settings.** `RetroGraphicsCatalog.settings` lists the SwanStation
options the page shows, in its order, each with a plain name and one line
(keys in `assets/l10n`). The keys and values come from SwanStation's
`src/libretro/libretro_core_options.h`:

| Option | On the page |
| --- | --- |
| `swanstation_GPU_ResolutionScale` | Resolution |
| `swanstation_GPU_TextureFilter` | Texture smoothing (Nearest, Bilinear, JINC2, xBR, each with or without edge blending) |
| `swanstation_GPU_MSAA` | Edge smoothing (multisample counts and SSAA) |
| `swanstation_GPU_PGXPEnable` | Steady 3D shapes |
| `swanstation_GPU_PGXPTextureCorrection`, `_PGXPCulling`, `_PGXPColorCorrection`, `_PGXPDepthBuffer` | Straight textures, Fewer gaps, Even shading, Depth sorting |
| `swanstation_GPU_TrueColor`, `_ScaledDithering`, `_ChromaSmoothing24Bit` | True colour, Fine dither pattern, Smooth videos |
| `swanstation_GPU_DisableInterlacing`, `_DownsampleMode`, `_WidescreenHack` | No interlacing, Downsampling, Widescreen |

The page lists only what `status.options` lists. A real host's status
(recorded in `test/fixtures/retro_host`) shows that SwanStation lists its
other PGXP options only while geometry correction is on. SwanStation's other
picture options that the menu shows (PGXP's tuning, the aspect ratio and
crop, Force NTSC Timings and the like) are on the page's More picture
settings section, with the host's titles. SwanStation's `Enabled` and `Disabled` show as On and
Off, and the texture filters get plain names. Every other label is the
host's.

**When a change takes effect.** A setting whose option has `restart: true`
says "Takes effect when the game is started again." after its line, as the
host reports it (the host's docs/host.md, "Options": "The host reports
`restart: true` for the options a core marks "(Restart)" at the end of their
text, as libretro cores do", and for a few SwanStation applies only at boot). A
setting whose chosen value is not yet its `activeValue` says it takes effect
in a moment.

**Presets.** Original is SwanStation's own defaults (1x, no smoothing, no
PGXP). Enhanced asks for 4x, bilinear textures, PGXP with straight textures
and fewer gaps, and smooth videos. Maximum asks for 8x, xBR, 4x MSAA, PGXP
and true colour. None of them changes Widescreen, which breaks 2D games, so
it is left to the player. A preset sends only values the host offers
(`RetroGraphicsCatalog.fit`): a number it does not offer becomes the largest
one below it, since protocol.md's `status` section says the host lists "only
the whole-number scales whose largest frame the host can pass on". Any other
value it does not offer is left out. A preset is sent in two passes, so the
PGXP options that appear once geometry correction is on get the preset's
values too. The preset row shows the preset the settings match, or Custom.

**Per game.** What the host took is kept in
`Preferences.retroHostGraphics[game.id]` and given at `start` over
`Preferences.retroHostOptions`, the options every game gets. Other games keep
theirs.

**The Auto Optimizer.** It is the launcher's Auto Optimizer
(`RetroOptimizer` and `RetroLaunchOptimizer` on `claude/integrated-0.1.22`)
for the host path. Check this PC reads `LauncherServices.retroHardware`: the
height of the display the launcher is on, the graphics adapters and
`Platform.numberOfProcessors`.

- **Windows:** the runner's `retroAdapters` lists the adapters through DXGI
  (`windows/runner/retro_adapters.cpp`), without software adapters, each with
  its `DedicatedVideoMemory`.
- **Linux:** `RetroVulkanAdapters` reads the devices the Vulkan driver lists,
  through `libvulkan.so.1`, on an isolate of its own. It creates an instance
  only, and opens no device. The kernel has no single place for this:
  `/sys/class/drm` gives an AMD card's video memory (`mem_info_vram_total`)
  but not NVIDIA's own driver's, and no names. Vulkan names every vendor's
  device, which is how games and emulators list them. The rules make the
  list match DXGI's. The CPU's device (Mesa's lavapipe) is left out. A
  discrete device's memory is its largest heap on the device; the heaps are
  not added up, as a Resizable BAR heap is part of the same memory. Any other
  device counts 0, since its device heap is shared system memory. A device
  two drivers both list (RADV and AMDVLK) counts once. No Vulkan loader, or a
  list that cannot be read whole, gives no adapters. The same code finds
  MoltenVK on a Mac (`libvulkan.1.dylib`, `libMoltenVK.dylib`), but the Mac
  has no host to optimize yet.

`RetroGraphicsOptimizer.recommend` then:

- picks the adapter as before: the only one with memory of its own, or the
  only one with at least 2 GiB;
- says why it has nothing to suggest when the computer cannot be read, no
  adapter can be told apart, or `status.hardware` is false (SwanStation's
  software renderer, where the resolution does nothing);
- suggests the resolution as the launcher's Balanced profile did: the
  display's height over 240, rounded up, no more than 4x, and no more than
  the adapter's memory allows (1x under 2 GiB, 2x from 2, 3x from 4, 4x from
  8 GiB);
- suggests bilinear textures without edge blending and smooth videos above
  1x, 2x MSAA from 8 GiB, PGXP from 4 CPU threads, and fine dithering;
- matches every value to one the host offers.

The page shows each change as "from → to". Apply sends them and keeps, for
each, the value the game had and what the player had saved, so Undo puts both
back. Undo works only while every setting still has the value Apply gave;
otherwise it is forgotten. A value the host no longer offers is matched to
one it does, as a preset's is, and a setting the host refuses stays in Undo.
Any change by hand on the page, a preset too, forgets Undo. Apply again,
with every change refused, leaves a speed check that is running as it was.

**The speed check.** After Apply, `RetroFrameMonitor` measures the game's
frame rate from the client's `frames` events (only those marked drawn), while
the game plays, is not paused and has no `graphicsPending`. The host
publishes a frame for each `retro_run` and paces `retro_run` to the core's
own rate, and SwanStation's hardware renderers hand over a frame on every
run, so a lower rate means the computer could not keep up. The check skips a
second (the renderer is remade) and counts the frames of the next three over
the time since the skipped second ended, so a stall anywhere in them lowers
the rate. It holds the rate against the PS1's own:
about 60 frames a second, or 50 for a PAL game. The host reports no rate, so
a game that ran faster than 50.5 frames a second before Apply (its last two
seconds of steady play) or after it counts as NTSC, however slow it is now.
An NTSC game that slows to between 46.5 and 50.5 with no rate from before
cannot be told from a PAL game, and is taken as one. Below 93 % of the rate,
the resolution goes down
one notch the host offers (at 1x, the multisample count), Undo still puts
back what the game had before Apply, and a toast tells the player. A rate
that holds says so in a toast too. The page shows what the check found.

## In the launcher

**The setting.** Settings › Emulators › **Run PS1 games in the separate
host** (`Preferences.retroHostPs1`) is off by default. The row shows only
where a host is found. `RetroHostInstall.locate` finds one only in a debug
build, as protocol.md "Finding and checking the host" allows: "Debug builds of
the launcher MAY run the host named by the environment variable
`ANYPS5_RETRO_HOST`, and any core, without the checks. Release builds ignore
that variable." The core is the SwanStation library beside that host
(`swanstation_libretro.dll` on Windows, `swanstation_libretro.so` on Linux),
as a host release's zip holds the two. A release build finds no host, so the
row is hidden and a PS1 disc goes to DuckStation as before, even with the
setting saved as on. With the setting on, a PS1 disc needs no DuckStation:
it is not shown as "Emulator required", and the PS1 folder on Home groups
its games. The row **PS1 BIOS folder** opens the folder the BIOS goes in.

**Starting.** `AppModel.play` sends a PS1 disc to `_playInHost` when
`playsInHost` says so. It asks the family rules first, as every start does,
then opens a host (`AppModel.openRetroHost`, which tests replace) with the
player's volume, and sends `start` with:

- `core`: the SwanStation library above;
- `disc`: the disc's file (`.cue`, `.chd`, `.pbp` or `.m3u`);
- `system`: `AppPaths.retroSystem`, `retro/system` in the launcher's
  settings folder, where protocol.md's `start` example keeps it;
- `saves`: `AppPaths.retroSaves`, `retro/saves/ps1` beside it;
- `options`: the SwanStation options the player chose in the menu before
  (`Preferences.retroHostOptions`), with that game's Graphics page settings
  over them (`Preferences.retroHostGraphics`).

The family play-time watcher follows the game as it follows any game
(`FamilyGate.followGame`), and a family limit that closes games closes it
through Close game. No other game starts while it plays. A host that cannot
be started at all (a file that is not a program) says so in a toast. Every
path is sent normalized, so it has no `.` or `..` segment (protocol.md
"Paths").

**One host for several games.** A game that is closed, or that ended, leaves
its host running for the next game when `RetroHostGame.detach()` says no game
is loaded. `RetroHostKeeper` (`AppModel.retroHostKeeper`) keeps that one host.
The next PS1 game takes it instead of starting a new one, as long as it is the
same host program, and sends it the player's volume again. The kept host is
shut down:

- once the player has left the PS1 games: the game selected is not a PS1
  disc that plays in the host, the setting was turned off, or another game
  is starting or running (`_letUnwantedRetroHostGo`, checked on every change
  of the launcher's state);
- after five minutes without a game (`RetroHostKeeper.idleLimit`);
- when the launcher goes away.

A kept host that ends by itself (it crashed, or exited after `release` as
protocol.md "release" allows) is forgotten and freed, and the next game starts
a new host, as protocol.md "Host failure" says: "The next game starts a new
host." A host that failed during a game is shut down when the game is left,
never kept.

**The host's environment.** On Windows the host gets the launcher's
environment. On Linux it gets the launcher's environment without what the
launcher's AppImage set (`RetroHostInstall.environmentFor`, which is
`GameProcess.withoutAppImage`), as a standalone emulator does: no `APPIMAGE`,
`APPDIR`, `ARGV0` or `OWD`, and not the AppImage's own `usr/share` at the head
of `XDG_DATA_DIRS`. `RetroHostClient.start` then gets it as the whole
environment (`inheritEnvironment: false`).

**The controllers.** `RetroHostControls` reads the app's own controller
reader: `ControllersModel.pads` in the launcher's order (Player 1, the
controller used last, first) and `ControllersModel.stateOf`. It turns the
motors through the reader's (`padMotors`), takes the dead zone from Settings ›
Controllers › Stick Dead Zone, and stops vibration when Settings › Behaviour ›
Controller Vibration is off.

**The keyboard.** `RetroKeyboard` plays the PS1 pad with the keys of the
game's Controls (`Controls.sources`: the launcher's layout with the keys the
player moved). Its state joins the controller at port 1, as a libretro
frontend binds the keyboard to player 1: buttons of both count, and a stick
comes from the keys while they tilt it. The touchpad's two halves are Select.
The stick modifier tilts the keyboard's sticks by the game's stick modifier
scale. Mouse buttons and the wheel are not read. The keys are read from
Flutter's `HardwareKeyboard.physicalKeysPressed` at each poll. While the game's
screen is in front, the launcher's own keys do nothing: only the in-game
shortcuts of Settings › Shortcuts (PS, the quick menu, a screenshot, a clip)
and full screen act. A PS1 game's Game Settings has a **Controls** row for its
keys.

**The game's screen.** `RetroPlayView` draws the game over the whole window,
over the home screen and under every layer. While it starts or loads it shows
the game's name and `status.progressLabel` (or "Loading the game…"), with a
progress line from `status.progressPercent` when the host gives one. On the
game's screen the controller is the game's: Cross, Circle, Start and the
D-pad reach the game, not the launcher. Only PS acts. PS, PS held, the quick
menu shortcut, and the mouse's right or Back button open the game's menu.
While the game loads, PS or Esc gives the start up.

**The menu.** `Layer.retroMenu` is a panel styled as the quick menu
("Paused", the game's icon and name), as tall as its rows. Its first page:
Resume, each disc of a multi-disc game ("In the console." under the inserted
one), Graphics (with a line saying what is in it), a row for each section
that has rows (Audio, Controller, Console, Advanced, each with a line saying
what is in it), and Close game. Graphics opens `Layer.retroGraphics`, the
Graphics page, with the sections Picture, Auto Optimizer and More picture
settings (SwanStation's other `GPU` and `Display` options that are shown, as
`RetroGameMenu.optionsIn(RetroOptionSection.graphics)` gives them, kept for
that game as the rest of the page is). The game stays paused there. Back
returns to the menu on Graphics, and PS to the game. Choosing a
section shows its page, headed with its name: its SwanStation options as
choices of their labels, and in Audio, Volume (a bar in tenths) and Mute
first. An option that takes effect only when the game starts again says so
under its title, and a chosen value not yet in effect says when it will be.
Back on a section's page goes back to the first page, on that section's row.
The menu always opens on its first page. Opening it pauses the game and keeps
the controllers out of it. PS, Options or Resume close it, and so does Back
on the first page. Any other layer over the
game (a family notice) pauses it the same way, and the game's own screen back
in front resumes it. The game's play time is counted for the family rules
until it ends, not until its error screen is left. A chosen option is kept in
`Preferences.retroHostOptions` once the host took it (a Graphics page
setting in that game's `Preferences.retroHostGraphics`), and the volume and mute
in `Preferences.retroHostVolume` and `retroHostMuted`, so the next game starts
with them.

**Ending.** Close game stops the game (the host writes the memory card) and
releases it, keeps the host for the next game (above), then the library comes
back. A game that
ends without an error goes back to the library the same way. A game that ends
with an error stays on its error screen ("Night Racer stopped") with the words
for its `errorCode` (`retroHostErrorKey`; a code the launcher does not know is
"The game stopped because of an error.", as protocol.md "Compatibility" asks),
and Enter or Cross goes back to the library. A host that speaks another
protocol version shows that it needs updating, and a host that never greeted
the launcher shows that it could not be started.

## Tests

The tests in `test/ui/retro_host` use a fake session and fake frames, kept in
native memory as a real ring slot would be, so no host is started.

- [`retro_frame_image_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/retro_frame_image_test.dart):
  - `rgba8` and `bgra8` frames read back as the right colours;
  - frames not marked drawn are skipped;
  - the copy is taken when the event arrives, so later writes to the slot do
    not show;
  - while an upload runs, only the newest frame is uploaded next;
  - `clear()` drops a frame still being uploaded.
- [`retro_host_game_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/retro_host_game_test.dart)
  covers:
  - the `start` argument;
  - the status example from the protocol's `status` section;
  - input filtering, pausing on focus loss and the player's own pause;
  - an ended status, a refused `start`, a host that never says `welcome`, and
    a host failure while playing;
  - stopping while waiting for `welcome`, and while `start` waits for its reply;
  - frames that arrive after the game ended or during shutdown;
  - focus changes after shutdown or a host failure;
  - `stop`, `shutdown` and `dispose`, including disposing before a game was
    started on a host that is gone;
  - `detach`: a host left running with no game and the next game started on
    it, a game that ended on its own released first, and the host shut down
    instead when it still holds a game, a call fails, it has ended or it was
    shut down.
- [`retro_host_keeper_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/retro_host_keeper_test.dart)
  checks that a kept host goes to the next game of the same program once,
  that one of another program, a second one kept, or one idle too long is
  shut down, and that a kept host that ends by itself is forgotten and freed.
- [`retro_option_sections_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/retro_option_sections_test.dart)
  sorts the fifty options of the recorded real status into their sections and
  the ten not shown, checks keys the recording lacks (port 2, multitap, a
  group SwanStation may add, another core's key), and the " (Restart)" titles.
- [`retro_host_launch_environment_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/retro_host_launch_environment_test.dart)
  starts `AppModel.openRetroHost` on Linux with a host that writes the
  environment it got: the AppImage's variables are gone, `XDG_DATA_DIRS` has
  lost the AppImage's folder, and nothing of the test process's own
  environment came in. It also checks that Windows keeps the launcher's
  environment and that an empty whole environment is refused.
- [`retro_host_game_view_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/retro_host_game_view_test.dart)
  checks the letterboxing and that a frame from the fake host reaches the
  screen. It also checks that an `inactive` lifecycle pauses the game and
  `resumed` resumes it, and that a view opened while the window is inactive
  tells its game at once.

  It also checks that a controller held while the window loses focus reaches
  the game again when focus comes back.
- [`retro_host_controls_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/retro_host_controls_test.dart)
  covers:
  - a port's state sent once, then on each change;
  - port 2 connected when a second controller sits down, or when the game
    loads with two, and let go when it leaves;
  - both ports sent again after focus comes back, also when focus is lost
    and back between two reads;
  - `suspended`, and a button held when it ends kept out until pressed
    again, also on a controller that sat down just before;
  - vibration sent to the controller at its port, a leaving controller's
    motors stopped, motors stopped when the host is shut down (also against a
    late `rumble`), vibration turned off, and `dispose`, which also lets go
    of held buttons;
  - a `rumble` that comes as one controller takes another's port, and
    controls made for a game already loaded sending the port count;
  - a button kept out after the menu closed that is let go and pressed again
    while the window has no focus.
- [`retro_game_menu_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/retro_game_menu_test.dart)
  builds the rows from the protocol's status example. It checks disc changes,
  option steps, volume steps and mute, volume set before `welcome`, and that
  opening the menu pauses the game and suspends the controls, also when it is
  opened again while closing still waits for the host, and that a menu
  disposed while open gives the controllers back.
- [`retro_graphics_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/retro_graphics_test.dart)
  runs `RetroGraphics` on a fake host whose options behave as the recorded
  host's ([`fake_option_session.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/fake_option_session.dart)):
  presets with a limited resolution list and the PGXP options that appear,
  a refused value, preview, Apply and Undo, Undo forgotten by a change by
  hand or elsewhere, Undo with a value no longer offered or refused, nothing
  to apply without the computer or the OpenGL renderer, and the speed check
  holding, stepping down (also with no rate before Apply, or a game already
  slow), stopped by a change by hand, left alone by an Apply refused, and
  ending with the game.
  [`retro_frame_monitor_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/retro_frame_monitor_test.dart)
  covers the steady rate across a pause, a measure's warm-up and wait,
  frames not drawn, and a stall while the game runs.
- [`retro_graphics_catalog_test.dart`](../test/core/retro_host/retro_graphics_catalog_test.dart),
  [`retro_graphics_optimizer_test.dart`](../test/core/retro_host/retro_graphics_optimizer_test.dart)
  and [`retro_graphics_profile_test.dart`](../test/core/retro_host/retro_graphics_profile_test.dart)
  replay the recorded status: the page's order, preset values the host has,
  matching to offered values, the suggestion for several computers, the
  adapter choice, one notch down, the kept profile in the preferences file,
  and the frame rate.
- [`retro_adapters_test.dart`](../test/core/retro_host/retro_adapters_test.dart)
  replays adapter lists read on real computers in `test/fixtures/retro_host`:
  - `dxgi_adapters_rtx4080super_radeon.json` is the output of
    `RetroAdapters()` itself, built with MSVC and run on a Windows PC with an
    RTX 4080 SUPER and a Radeon iGPU on 13 November 2026. It goes through the
    channel's codec and `parseRetroAdapters`, and on that PC's 5120x1440
    display with 16 threads the Auto Optimizer picks the RTX (16,824,401,920
    bytes) and suggests 4x, smooth textures, 2x MSAA and PGXP.
  - `vulkan_devices_windows_rtx4080super_radeon.json` is
    `RetroVulkanAdapters.readDevices()` on the same PC. The RTX's device heap
    is the same 16,824,401,920 bytes DXGI gives. The iGPU's device heap is
    33,975,631,872 bytes of shared memory, so it counts 0, and the advice is
    the same.
  - `vulkan_devices_linux_lavapipe.json` is the same reader on Linux (WSL
    with Mesa's lavapipe), which is left out as a software device.

  The tests also check that a device two drivers list counts once, that heaps
  are not added up, that a recording that is not whole is refused, and that
  the computer running the tests is read without failing. The same reader in
  WSL gave an empty list with a loader and no driver, and none with no
  loader.
- [`retro_pad_test.dart`](../test/core/retro_host/retro_pad_test.dart) checks
  every button against the protocol's bit table, the triggers, both ends of
  the stick range and the dead zone.
  [`retro_seats_test.dart`](../test/core/retro_host/retro_seats_test.dart)
  covers who sits where as controllers come and go.
- [`fake_retro_host_session.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/fake_retro_host_session.dart)
  holds the fakes: the session, frames, controllers (`FakePads`) and motors
  (`FakeMotors`).
- [`retro_host_play_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host_play_test.dart)
  plays a PS1 disc from a games folder through the launcher with a fake host
  ([`ps1_launcher.dart`](../test/support/ps1_launcher.dart)): the setting off
  (DuckStation as before) and without a host, the `start` argument with the
  player's paths, volume and options, the controller kept from the launcher
  on the game's screen, PS opening and closing the menu, the menu's first page
  and each section's page against the recorded real status (Back to the first
  page on the section's row, the restart marks, what is kept), options not
  shown and not sent, Close game keeping the host and the next game starting
  on it, the kept host shut down when the player leaves the PS1 games, after
  the idle limit and when another game starts, a kept host that crashed and a
  host that crashed during a game (both replaced by a new host for the next
  game), a host still holding a game after `release` (shut down), an error
  screen, a clean end, an outdated host, and a start given up. It also
  opens the Graphics page: its names, a preset kept for that game only,
  Custom, Back to the menu, PS to the game, a game started with its own
  graphics, and the Auto Optimizer's rows, its toast and Undo.
- [`retro_host_play_golden_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host_play_golden_test.dart)
  draws the loading screen, the error screen, the game's picture, the menu's
  first page over it, its Console page, the Graphics page with Enhanced
  chosen, the Auto Optimizer's suggestion, and Settings › Emulators with the
  host's rows.
- [`retro_keyboard_test.dart`](../test/core/retro_host/retro_keyboard_test.dart)
  checks the keyboard layout as a PS1 pad, a moved key, the stick modifier
  and the keys joining a controller.
  [`retro_host_install_test.dart`](../test/core/retro_host/retro_host_install_test.dart)
  checks where the host and core are found, and that a release build finds
  none.

A widget test runs in fake time, but images are made by the engine in real
time. So the view test waits for a picture by taking turns: a short real wait
(`tester.runAsync`), then `tester.pump()`.

```bash
flutter test test/ui/retro_host test/ui/retro_host_play_test.dart test/ui/retro_host_play_golden_test.dart \
  test/core/retro_host/retro_pad_test.dart test/core/retro_host/retro_seats_test.dart \
  test/core/retro_host/retro_keyboard_test.dart test/core/retro_host/retro_host_install_test.dart
```

### Against the real host

[`retro_host_game_real_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/retro_host_game_real_test.dart)
runs `RetroHostGame`, `RetroHostControls` and `RetroGameMenu` against the real
host. It reads the same `ANYPS5_RETRO_HOST_REAL` file as the client's real
test ([RETRO_HOST_CLIENT.md](RETRO_HOST_CLIENT.md)), with one more optional
key, `fakeCore`: the host repository's test core (`tests/fake_core.c`, built
beside the host as `fake_core.dll` or `libfake_core.so`). Without the variable
the test is skipped, so CI skips it. Without `fakeCore` only the second case
is skipped.

- **SwanStation.** OpenBIOS boots the PS-EXE. The game reaches `playing`, and
  its `picture` shows two pictures that are not black and differ. A second
  controller sits down at port 2 and then leaves. The test records the calls
  that go through the session: the controls sent `connectedPorts` with `2`,
  then `1`, and the host answered `true` to both. `stop` then ends the game
  with no error.
- **The test core.** The test core's own description says it "rumbles port
  1's large motor while Cross is held". So holding Cross on the controller at
  port 1 must reach the core through `input`, and the core's vibration must
  come back to that controller's motors at full strength, then stop when
  Cross is let go. The menu then steps the core's `fake_color` option from
  Blue to Green, and the picture turns green. Choosing the second disc of a
  two-disc `.m3u` ends with `discs.inserted` at 1, not busy and not failed.

Both cases passed on Windows on 13 November 2026, with the host built from
the host repository's `stage2-gpu` branch (bde086e) with WinLibs GCC 15.2,
and SwanStation built for Windows.

[`retro_graphics_real_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/retro_graphics_real_test.dart)
reads the same file. SwanStation runs the OpenBIOS test program, its frame
rate is measured, Enhanced is chosen through `RetroGraphics`, every value is
checked as the core's `activeValue` (the PGXP options showed up), and the
frames must still come at more than 54 a second. It passed on Windows on
13 November 2026 with the host and SwanStation from `.local/workspace/Latest`
(the `gpu` branch's resolution limits): 60.15 frames a second before and
60.07 after, at 4x.

[`retro_host_app_real_test.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/retro_host_app_real_test.dart)
reads the same file and runs the whole launcher against the real host: the
host and SwanStation are copied into one folder that `ANYPS5_RETRO_HOST`
names, the PS-EXE is put on a disc in a games folder, OpenBIOS goes in the
PS1 BIOS folder, and `AppModel.play` starts the disc with the setting on. The
game reaches `playing` and shows two pictures that differ. A second
controller in the app's controller reader connects port 2. PS opens the menu
(the host takes `pause`) on Graphics and its four sections, Graphics
opens and the resolution is changed and kept for that game, Back returns
to the menu, each section's page holds only
SwanStation options, CD-ROM Read Speedup is changed in Console and kept, the
volume is set in Audio and kept, and PS resumes. Close game leaves the host
running with a memory card written. The same disc then plays again in the
same host (its frames carry epoch 2, as protocol.md "start" counts games in a
host), Close game keeps the host again, and turning the setting off shuts it
down with a clean exit. Its helpers, shared with the test above, are
in [`real_host_support.dart`](../test/ui/retro_host/real_host_support.dart).
It passed on Windows on 13 November 2026 with the same host and SwanStation
builds, and again with the sections and the kept host the same day. The host runs with the test's own environment, as the launcher starts
it, so WinLibs' `bin` folder has to be on `PATH` there.

## Not yet

- **Release builds.** Only debug builds find a host. Release builds get the
  signed host release, with the checks of protocol.md "Finding and checking
  the host", later.
- **No phone pad.** A phone or browser pad (Remote Play's) does not play a
  PS1 game in the host, and does not move the launcher while the game's own
  screen is in front.
- **No mouse.** The mouse buttons and the wheel in a game's Controls are not
  read for a PS1 game.
- **The Auto Optimizer on Linux with a real card.** The Vulkan reader has run
  on Linux only with Mesa's software device (WSL has no GPU driver for it), and
  on real cards only on Windows. The display height comes from Flutter's
  Linux display list, which has not been checked in the app. A computer with
  only built-in graphics gets "no adapter could be told apart" on Linux, where
  Windows counts the small memory DXGI reports for it.
- **One step down.** The speed check lowers one notch once. It does not
  measure again after that, and it does not change the PGXP or smoothing
  settings.
- **One copy per frame.** Each frame is copied once and uploaded through
  `decodeImageFromPixels`. A texture that shares the ring with the GPU would
  avoid the copy. That is worth doing only if a trace shows the copy costs
  frames.
